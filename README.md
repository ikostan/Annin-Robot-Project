# Annin Robot Project

## 6 axis stepper motor robot and control software

This project includes:

- Bill of materials and instructions
- CAD files to 3D print components to build the robot
- Arduino sketch for stepper driver control
- Software to program and operate robot

All geared stepper motors and drivers are available from  [www.omc-stepperonline.com](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/?tracking=59c1139e8987b)
all other misc hardware are off the shelf items available from multiple sources (see the bill of materials file)

This was my first Arduino program and my first python application using the Tk module.
I hope people will enjoy building thier own robot, utilize and improve the software
and design and build bigger and better robot units and share thier designs.

1. review the bill of materials
2. review the assembly instructions
3. download models and build robot
4. review calibration video [Calibration Video](https://youtu.be/jC1Iq60EnBI)
5. review programming video [Programming Video](https://youtu.be/hFJe0j0nB_w)
